  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-chan-skid23/"
      >Matt Chan</a
    > (he/they). I'm a <b>Skidmore College</b> graduate (2023): CS major and
    English minor. I'm a software developer and part-time writer of both fiction
    and non-fiction. My current focus is on <b>full-stack web development</b>!
  </p>

  <p>
    Full stack can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. Here's what "full
    stack" means to me:

    <b>you're willing to learn from the bottom-up</b>, the nitty gritty. Of
    course, in the end, you don't know what you don't know. But I do feel that
    you should at least know what an <a
      href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc9293.html">RFC</a
    > is if you would like to call yourself full-stack.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>We stand on the shoulders of giants.</b> Shortcuts, and especially those
    that write of past mistakes, often don't pay off! It took a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom">very special book</a
    > (along with some <em>tough</em> life lessons) to convince me otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, I get that a site built on a <a href="https://astro.build"
      >framework-of-frameworks</a
    > on a <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">globally distributed CDN</a>
     isn't especially bottom-up... And you'd be right! If you want bottom up
    from me, visit
    <a href="https://mc.maatwo.com">mc.maatwo.com</a>, either with your web
    browser or a certain video game associated with port number 25565 üòè
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is a place of <a
      href="https://github.com/multimattia/astro-starter-blog/commits/main/"
      >constant iteration and experimentation</a
    >: proper syntax highlighting, dynamically generated tag pages, a functional
    navbar (üòÖ), typographical tweaks, layout tweaks, and, in the near future, a
    rework of the CI/CD pipeline, some React, Svelte, and/or Solid components,
    some API integrations and/or analytics (don't worry, I'm keeping big G out
    of this)...
  </p>

  <p>
    What I'm saying is: although "move fast and break things" might not be the
    wisest choice in production, I feel that it's more than a valid way to
    learn. As such, things might not always be working as intended. Take care to
    not trip over something while you're in my little corner of the internet! I
    hope you enjoy your stay :)
  </p>
