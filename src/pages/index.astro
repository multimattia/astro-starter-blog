  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-chan-skid23/"
      >Matt Chan</a
    > (he/they). I'm a Skidmore College graduate (2023): CS major and English
    minor. I'm a software developer and part-time writer of both fiction and
    non-fiction. My current focus is on <b>full-stack web development</b>!
  </p>

  <p>
    Full stack can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. Here's what "full
    stack" means to me: I'm willing to learn from the bottom-up. In the case of
    the web ‚Äî where the term "full-stack" is most often used ‚Äî that means
    understanding of the protocols on which the internet is built on. At a
    minimum, I do feel that an awareness of
    <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc9293.html">RFCs</a> is necessary is if
    you would like to call yourself full-stack.
  </p>

  <p>
    We stand on the shoulders of giants. Shortcuts, and especially those that
    somehow reinvent the wheel at the same time, often don't pay off! It took a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom">very special book</a
    > (along with some <em>tough</em> life lessons) to convince me otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, I get that a site built on a <a href="https://astro.build"
      >framework-of-frameworks</a
    > on a <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">globally distributed CDN</a>
     isn't especially bottom-up... And you'd be right! If you want bottom up
    from me, visit
    <a href="https://mc.maatwo.com">mc.maatwo.com</a>, either with your web
    browser or a certain video game associated with port number 25565 üòè
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is a place of <a
      href="https://github.com/multimattia/astro-starter-blog/commits/main/"
      >constant iteration and experimentation</a
    >. Although "move fast and break things" might not be the wisest choice in
    production, I feel that it's more than a valid way to learn. As such, things
    might not always be working as intended. Take care to not trip over
    something while you're in my little corner of the internet! I hope you enjoy
    your stay :)
