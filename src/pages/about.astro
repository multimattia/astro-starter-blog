  <h1>Who am I?</h1>
  <p>
    Hi there! I'm Matt Chan (he/they), a software developer from Hong Kong who
    likes building things that spark joy, both for myself and others. I have a
    Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in <Tooltip
      text="English"
      hover="Creative writing!"
    />from <a href="https://www.skidmore.edu/computer_science/"
      >Skidmore College</a
    >! I'm currently located in Brooklyn, NY. I write, but not often enough!
  </p>
  <p>
    I've designed, developed, configured, and deployed everything from:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Automation and consolidation of post purchase operations between
        multiple SaaS <Tooltip
          text="products"
          hover="Stripe, Monday.com, Zapier, Bubble.io, Kajabi, Slack"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        Marketing and e-commerce websites with Stripe and <Tooltip
          text="Wix"
          hover="Yes, this WAS the right tool for the job ðŸ˜¬"
        />
      </li>
      <li>Nginx reverse-proxies and websites with Oracle's cloud solution</li>
      <li>
        Modded Minecraft servers on the cloud (also on <Tooltip
          text="Oracle"
          hover="Their free tier is generous -- 4 cores and 24 gigs of ram!"
        />)
      </li>
      <li>Literally-on-demand streaming services</li>
      <li>
        A programmable Playwright testing suite (before the real one came
        along!)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also a co-founder of Skidmore's Computer Science club. There, I adapted
    and delivered lectures about everyone's favorite version control system:
    Git.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've found that it's healthier for me to talk about our hobbies and
    interests than to stay alone with them for too long.
  </p>

  <p>I like to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Play bass â€“ recently found a Tbird for $300 off!</li>
    <li>
      Make side projects â€“ right now, I'm working on <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://boomboxd.vercel.app">Boomboxd</a
      >, a Spotify playlist annotator that is quickly getting out of <Tooltip
        text="out of scope."
        hover="yet somehow feature-thin..."
      />
    </li>
    <li>Read â€“ currently reading through Greg Egan's Axiomatic collection.</li>
    <li>
      Mess around with a
      <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/voyager/layouts/alBEv/rnPx9/0"
        >keyboard layout.</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      And I wouldn't be much of a CS major if I didn't play video games. I'm
      open to most genres, but I've got a soft spot for Supergiant games. <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://citizensleeper.com/">Citizen Sleeper</a
      > is my current favorite.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If any of the above interests you, <a

      >shoot me an email</a
    > or connect with me on <a
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-chan-skid23/">LinkedIn</a
