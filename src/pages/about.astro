  <h1>Who am I?</h1>
  <p>
    Hi there! I'm Matt Chan (he/they), a software developer from Hong Kong who
    likes building things that spark joy, both for myself and others. I have a
    Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in <Tooltip
      text="English"
      hover="Creative writing!"
    />from <a href="https://www.skidmore.edu/computer_science/"
      >Skidmore College</a
    >! I'm currently located in Brooklyn, NY. I write occasionally.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've designed, developed, configured, and deployed everything from:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Automation and consolidation of post purchase operations between
        multiple SaaS <Tooltip
          text="products"
          hover="Stripe, Monday.com, Zapier, Bubble.io, Kajabi, Slack"
        />
      </li>
      <li>
        Marketing and e-commerce websites with Stripe and <Tooltip
          text="Wix"
          hover="Yes, this WAS the right tool for the job ðŸ˜¬"
        />
      </li>
      <li>Nginx reverse-proxies and websites with Oracle's cloud solution</li>
      <li>
        Modded Minecraft servers on the cloud (also on <Tooltip
          text="Oracle"
          hover="Their free tier is generous -- 4 cores and 24 gigs of ram!"
        />)
      </li>
      <li>Literally-on-demand streaming services</li>
      <li>
        A programmable Playwright testing suite (before the real one came
        along!)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also a co-founder of Skidmore's Computer Science club. There, I adapted
    and delivered lectures about everyone's favorite version control system:
    Git!
  </p>
  <p>
    I've found that, for me, it's healthier to talk about our hobbies and
    interests than to stay alone with them for too long.
  </p>

  <p>I like to:</p>

    This website was made with an iteration or two of Josh W. Comeau's <a

    I don't have much to lose, but I do have a lot that I <em>want</em> to
    prove. I'm willing to put in the work for it. This is my website. I'll be
    using it as accountability for myself.
