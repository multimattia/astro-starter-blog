      <h2>Prattling on about myself</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an CS grad from Skidmore College with not much left to lose,
        everything to prove, and a hard time limit of 8 months before Freeze
        Force kicks me out of the US. Welcome to my blog, proudly on Astro: an
        SSG focussed on delivering a minimal amount of JavaScript with a
        React-like component architecture!
      </p>
      <p>More facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
        <li>
          I currently am in {identity.country} and I'm newly {
            identity.occupation
          }. Fun!
        </li>
        {
          identity.hobbies.length >= 1 && (
            <li>
              Two of my hobbies: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}
            </li>
          )
        }
      </ul>
      <p>
        My skills include (but are not limited to (also take with a grain of
        salt I'm just trying out the astro's js mapping))
      </p>
      <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </BaseLayout>
