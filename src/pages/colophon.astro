  <p>
    This website was designed and built by yours truly! Its my spot on the
    internet, and where I can show off the things I've done. Most importantly,
    it's a place for me to learn in public. This version of the website is very
    loosely based on <a
      href="https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/"
      >Astro's blog tutorial</a
    >, but the very first iteration of this website was built using Gatsby.
  </p>

  <h2><strong>Framework</strong></h2>
  <p>
    I chose Astro because I knew I needed an extensible platform that sticks to
    fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Astro also borrows
    some React ideas, like components, which I'm a big fan of. The client
    receives plain HTML/CSS by default, and I'm a big fan of that. I'm not so
    much a fan of sending dozens of kilobytes of JavaScript to the user. It's
    wasteful on both the user, the network, and the server. Use the browser!
  </p>
  <h2><strong>Deployment</strong></h2>
  <p>
    This website's deployment is handled by Cloudflare Pages. I chose
    Cloudflare's platform because of their CDN(content delivery network), and
    generous free tier! And, most critically: their network runs on <a
      href="https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-creates-new-blueprint-for-zero-emissions-internet/"
      >100% renewable energy</a
    >. With Astro's small filesizes, each visit to this website generates 0.02g
    of CO2.
