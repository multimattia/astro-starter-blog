Lots of words are coming today. I'm typing some font in **bold** and some in _italics_ just to see the font style. Maybe something in ~~strikethrough~~ as well?

## Some lists now

### An unfunny joke:

1. Find someone who doesn't know what a [modal text editor](https://github.com/lapce/lapce) is.
2. Sit them down in front of a UNIX command line terminal.
3. Have them type `vim`, then enter.
4. Ask them to try and leave the program.
