Here's a new blog that I'm finally getting around to doing! It's going to replace to replace my old Gatsby blog (that never really had any content) over at mattchan.xyz, that I never updated after completing the initial tutorial back in 2020. Maybe I'll have something more to say now (I do).

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: Deployed this thing on Cloudflare Pages. It was much easier than I thought it would be. I need to look into how Cloudflare pages is rerouting my wildcard domain (that I configured on Porkbun) to this page. Maybe I did some configurating that I have simply forgotten. Also the SSL was nice.

2. **Making Pages**: I'm learning about Astro's file router by following along on their docs. They're well done! Maybe a bit too easy for me but I try my best to avoid saying that. I'm just very afraid of tutorial hell, which is why I'm using my brain to write this instead of copy-pasting from the docs! Progress.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: And this is the progress that I was _just_ talking about. So much fun. Just typing away on my little puter. Maybe I'll start another post for the fun of it.

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this for a blog of a blog about a yet another Rust based text editor! And also my collaborative Next.js project. And also my keymaps with my new fangled QMK keyboard.
