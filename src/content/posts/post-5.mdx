I'm pretty careful about not getting COVID. I wear an N-95 mask when in public, know to monitor COVID wastewater data, etc.

But like many, I've slacked off on getting that new vaccine. This wasn't a huge deal to me at the time -- I was planning for
a quiet New Years' and Christmas, and generally don't go to big social gatherings aside from Meetup or two.

I am fortunate to have recieved 4 COVID <Tooltip text="vaccines" hover="Pfizer gang, but it seems that Moderna's protection lasts longer because of its larger mRNA payload. Oh well." />
as this point. I knew that I would be put out of order for the next few days with each immunization. This was okay in college,
and if I were still at Skidmore I would have been first in line. But this wasn't okay at my job. I was in an on-call role
with a <Tooltip text="flexible" hover="For both good and bad. Not making any pointed statements here." /> attendance policy.
It was crunch time, and I could not afford to slip up.

As an aside, this was also about the time where I had actually grown up and developed some empathy for those who had not received their
vaccines sooner; I remember earlier in the pandemic not fully understanding why vaccination rates were low, and not just
because of the anti-vaxxers. I hadn't fully appreciated the luxury of time and an attendance policy. Let's continue.

_"I'll just be extra careful when I'm out of the house. If I stay inside, I'll be fine!"_

This is what I came to around early December when first hearing about the vaccine. I was incorrect, and life had another lesson
prepared for me: the _correct_ conclusion I should have come to is that I was fighting a losing battle on all sides. I
had all the information already -- with COVID left to mutate and fester in the several billion bodies that it has
infected since 2020, I _knew_ any variant to emerge from that would be a transmission _machine_. I just didn't have the
bandwidth to think about it.

And, sure enough, I tested positive for COVID for the second time. It has been a year since my last vaccine and this new JN.1
strain will not make my infection go more easy. I'm fairly certain I got it from a roommate who
was isolating in _the room below me_<Tooltip text="." hover="To be clear, this is not an attack on them!" />And they were
careful about this stuff! We live in a pre-war home where room-to-room insulation is poor, but still, I had taken
precautions: I was using a fan for positive air pressure.

But still, here I am, alone in my room typing this blog on my computer, surrounded by bottles of chocolate Soylent and
positive RAT results. I wasn't even safe in my own bed. I'm powerless to do anything.
Why do I see no-one wearing masks on the subway? Did people forget about the stories from doctors in the ER about the
ventilators, the forearm-sized plastic tubes shoved down your throat for weeks? About long COVID and its unending brainfog?

It's my current understanding that COVID-19 is worse than the flu: COVID-19 attacks your heart, brain, kidneys, and all
manner of organs in a lasting, perhaps even permanent way that we don't fully understand even now, _4 years into the pandemic_.
It follows that COVID-19 should not be rolled up with influenza as a disease of similar severity.

I, along with the rest of my household, am part of the second largest wave of COVID in the United States. As of today, 01/04/24,
[two million Americans are getting COVID per _day_](https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1742920414534513200/photo/1).

Why is this? While yes, some of the blame can be placed on the lack of vaccine uptake, of which I am also guilty <Tooltip text="of;" hover="I have done enough self-flagellation for the both of us before you get angry at this next paragraph. Let me vent" />
we can also place some of the blame on the media -- it seems that even they have become victims of pandemic fatigue: the
Washington Post claims this wave to be an ["uptick"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/01/04/covid-2024-us-jn1/).
But this can't be the entire picture. I don't want to believe that the public would be okay with this if they understood why treating
COVID as seasonal is a variant factory. I am fortunate enough to have the time to be obsesssed with this.
Where is the government messaging on any of this? And other authorities? The WHO has not assigned a new name to a
variant since Omicron.

The percentage of people who suffer from long COVID
is distressingly high, and can only go up. What will we do then? We can't lean on Paxlovid as we do now -- its MSRP is
USD$1390, and the government stockpile is quickly evaporating. It's a blessing in disguise that I am uninsured --
I was fortunate enough to have secured a 5-day dosage for the antiviral drug, but can the same be said for
people in the same position as me a year from now?
