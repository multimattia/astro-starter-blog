_To be clear, I'm taking the L here, I was underprepared for the OA. Dunning-Kruger in full effect here. I just really
like venting. Maybe `${BIG_TECH_COMPANY}` will be kind to me._

And hey, I promised that I would be learning in public! Maybe reading about this will help you with your own
journey.

- Take the mock OA and the real OA in succession and lull yourself into a false sense of security when you finish the
  mock in half the time

- Get as little sleep as possible beforehand

- Opt for solving the problems locally (I use Vim btw), but make sure to not commit and/or push anything until the last
  minute

- Prioritize having nice-ish Typescript annotations in your code instead of getting the tests to pass

- Make sure that you only have a vague awareness of the countdown so you run overtime

- Forget the CSS sibling operators even though you've used them multiple times (in this very website!)

- Prioritize the hexadecimal binary operator question over the longer React question

- Take 5 minutes to install prettier because you think it'll make you stand out versus using those 5 minutes to make sure
  the tests pass

### So, what have I learned from this ~~nightmare~~ experience?

I need to take better care of myself. Some things, no matter how desperate I am or how much
I want them, need some mental preparation directly beforehand, no matter how much you've prepared for them in the past.
