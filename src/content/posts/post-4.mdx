Are you tired of having code that looks like this?

```js
import Navigation from "../../../anotherFolderOfComponents/Navigation.astro";
import Hamburger from "../../../anotherFolderOfComponents/Hamburger.astro";
import ThemeIcon from "../../../anotherFolderOfComponents/ThemeIcon.astro";
```

Wouldn't you much prefer code that looks like _this_?

```js
import Navigation from "@components/Navigation.astro";
import Hamburger from "@components/Hamburger.astro";
import ThemeIcon from "@components/ThemeIcon.astro";
```

Well I have a solution for you! We can use `tsconfig.json`'s compilerOptions flags to create **aliased** imports!

```json
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@assets/*": [
        "src/assets/*"
      ],
      "@pages/*": [
        "src/pages/*"
      ],
      "@components/*": [
        "src/components/*"
      ],
      "@layouts/*": [
        "src/layouts/*"
      ],
      "@images/*": [
        "src/assets/images/*"
      ],
      "@posts/*": [
        "src/content/posts/*"
      ],
    }
  }
```

Much better!
