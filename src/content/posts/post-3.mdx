First: what is it?

> _"**Yak shaving** (uncountable):_
>
> _1. Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing one to overcome intermediate difficulties, allows one to solve a larger problem._

> _2. A less useful activity done consciously or subconsciously to procrastinate about a larger but more useful task._

How does this apply to me? Well, perhaps most tangibly, yak shaving is most likely why I'm where I am (make of that what
you will ðŸ˜…)! What I thought was work was really just intense procrastination. I was spending _way_ too much time
looking on how to do things the _right_ way instead of actually working my way up through it, mistakes and all. I wanted
to come in with a perfect solution that was CI/CD ready, 200% tested, and following 300% of the accessibility standards
just to provide an immediate value add, but I spent so much time looking at how to do that I ended up _dragging my feet
on actually doing the thing._

It's been popping up again in a few other places, a group project, for one. Web development is complicated, and you're
often operating on so many layers of abstraction that it's easy for you to feel like you might be doing something wrong,
in _any_ portion of the gigantic technology stack that somehow turns into a website.

But with all this, if I were to be honest with myself and really drill down on my reasons for yak shaving... That's
reducible to a simple thing: a fear of failure.

When I'm doing projects with an unclear completion state (and so, a higher risk of failure!) I've been finding that
this blog is an effective way to galvanize myself! Especially when stress management's been getting difficult with the
amount of stuff that's been going on in my life recently. It's probably not the best move to share it here.

But I am making progress. Look at that image! As trivial as it seems it took a lot to get right â€” check out that
wonderfully optimized .webp format: 37.1 kilobytes! And most importantly, it wasn't too difficult that I spent too much
time spinning my wheels.

I've also been using [Timing](https://timing.app) to keep myself accountable It's been working
well! I'll be elaborating on this later.

  &quot;productive&quot; for ~74% of that time!"

In the end, the best way to get over this is to _keep making stuff_, in a way that clearly shows the next easily
digestible path forward, while still posing a challenge that can't be easily cheated with a search engine. Ignore the
voice in your head that you could be doing things better for now, especially if you've been struggling to make it happen.
It just means that you're not ready **yet**.

I think that continuing to break things down into more easily digestible pieces will only lead to good things -- it
really is just problem solving. You **will** be ready if you keep failing forward. And that's what I'll do.

but also don't fall into tutorial hell kthxbye
