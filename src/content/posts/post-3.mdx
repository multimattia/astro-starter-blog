First: what is it?

> _"**Yak shaving** (uncountable):_
>
> _1. Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing one to overcome intermediate difficulties, allows one to solve a larger problem._

> _2. A less useful activity done consciously or subconsciously to procrastinate about a larger but more useful task._

How does this apply to me? Well, perhaps most tangibly, yak shaving is most likely why I'm where I am (make of that what you will ðŸ˜…)! What I thought was work
was really just intense procrastination. I was spending _way_ too much time looking on how to do things the _right_ way instead of actually
working my way up through it, mistakes and all. I wanted to come in with a perfect solution that was CI/CD ready, 200%
tested, and following 300% of the accessibility standards just to provide an immediate value add, but I spent so
much time looking at how to do that I ended up _dragging my feet on actually doing the thing._

It's been popping up again in a few other places, a group project, for one. Web development is complicated, and you're
often operating on so many layers of abstraction that it's easy for you to feel like you might be doing something wrong,
in _any_ portion of the gigantic technology stack that somehow ends up turning into a website.

But if I were to boil my reasons for yak shaving down to a few words: it's a fear of failure.

I'm getting over this setback, and again I'm coming back to this website as a way to do so. But stress management's
definitely been getting difficult with the amount of stuff that's been going on in my life recently. It's probably not
the best move to share it here.

But I am making progress (take a look at that image! As trivial as it seems it took a lot to get right --
look at that wonderfully optimized .webp format: 37.1 kilobytes!).

I've also been using [Timing](https://timing.app), a time logging app, to keep myself accountable, and it's been working
well! I'll most likely be writing another post on this.

  &quot;productive&quot; for ~74% of that time!"

In the end, the best way to get over this is to _keep making stuff_. Ignore the voice in your head that you could be doing
things better for now, especially if you've been struggling to make it happen. It means that you're not ready **yet**.
Break things down into more easily digestible pieces (it really is just problem solving). You **will** be ready if you keep
failing forward. And that's what I'll do.

but also don't fall into tutorial hell kthxbye
