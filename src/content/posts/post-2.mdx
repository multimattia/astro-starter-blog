There's a lot I want to do with this blog, and a bunch of reasons why I want to do it. First: it's probably the coolest way I can think of to be able to encode my learning as something permanent, something that I can point back to and say, "yeah, I did that".

And, with Astro's .mdx integration, I'll be able to integrate entire `${JavaScript framework and/or library of choice}` components to support these claims. I'm constantly impressed by [Josh W. Comeau's](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/keyframe-animations/) and [Bartosz Ciechanowski's](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/) blogposts and how they're able to make pieces of information so _sticky_ and easily understandable by way of good, clear prose, thoughtful illustrations, and fun-and-sometimes-unexpected interactions. The best UI experiences make their processes look effortless, and I feel that embarking on this blogging journey will be a great way for me to learn things, รก la the Feynmann Technique.

To be less haughty about it, this means that I'll start questioning my own thoughts in a way that makes me uncomfortable. It will be slower and more difficult than writing slapdash notes on a notepad when I feel like it, but it's been shown that actually publishing something means that I will treat it with greater care; especially due to the nature of the medium: on my own URL, on technology that I chose, and in my layout. My website is more or less a direct representation of my current technical capability to express as much of my personality. This is both cool and terrifying at the same time, but I do feel like the effort will be more than worth it.

Software developers never stop learning. It would be prudent for me to share my learning here.
