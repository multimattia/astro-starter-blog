import example from "@images/example.avif";
import BlogImage from "@components/BlogImage.astro";

Images that you want Astro to pre-process should first be moved to any folder within the `src` directory.
As an example, I've set up an [import alias](/posts/post-4), where images are in `src/assets/images`, see below:

```js
import example from "@images/example.jpg";
import timing_app_upscale from "@images/timing_app_upscale.png";
import BlogImage from "@components/BlogImage.astro";
```

I've created a component, `BlogImage`, that will display a caption underneath the image, which uses Astro's `Image`
under the hood to minimize [CLS](https://web.dev/articles/cls) and payload size by pre-processing the given image to
.webp.

This `BlogImage` component takes in two props, the directory of the image (`src`), and the alt text (`alt`).

You can embed this `BlogImage` component directly into your markdown posts. One caveat is that CSS selectors for
this component have been declared inline to circumvent .mdx styling limitations, so please ensure that your CSS
selectors have enough specificity to avoid cascades into the rest of the post page.

Here's the `BlogImage` component in its entirety:

```astro
---
// @components/BlogImage.astro
import { Image } from "astro:assets";
const { src, alt } = Astro.props;
---

<div class="blogimage">
  <Image class="image" src={src} alt={alt} />
  <figcaption id="imgcap">{alt}</figcaption>
</div>

<!-- Style is inline to work inside .mdx posts -->
<style is:inline>
  .blogimage {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 0.35rem;
    margin: 1rem 0;
  }

  .blogimage .image {
    max-width: 97%;
    height: auto;
    border-radius: 7px;
  }

  .blogimage figcaption {
    font-size: 0.85rem;
  }

  /* Replace with your own desktop media query */
  @media screen and (min-width: 687px) {
    .blogimage .image {
      max-width: 98%;
    }
  }
</style>
```

And here's how it's used inside an `.mdx` file:

```astro
<BlogImage
  src={example}
  alt="This is an example! Courtesy to Kaung Myat Min on Unsplash."
/>
```

<BlogImage
  src={example}
  alt="This is an example! Courtesy to
Kaung Myat Min on Unsplash."
/>

If you use `pnpm`,
the package `sharp` is not installed alongside Astro. You'll need to run

```
pnpm i sharp
```

to get Astro's image pre-processor to work.
