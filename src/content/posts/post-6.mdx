import example from "@images/example.avif";
import BlogImage from "@components/BlogImage.astro";

Images that you want optimized by Astro be moved to any folder within the `src` directory.
As an example, I've set up an [import alias](/posts/post-4), see below:

```js
import example from "@images/example.jpg";
import timing_app_upscale from "@images/timing_app_upscale.png";
import BlogImage from "@components/BlogImage.astro";
```

You can embed this `BlogImage` component directly into your markdown posts, but for styling purposes I found it easier
to create a custom component that I can embed into the post. One caveat is that any CSS selectors for this component must
be declared inline, so please ensure that your CSS selectors have enough specificity to avoid cascading into the rest of
the post page.

I've created a component, `BlogImage`, that will display a caption underneath the image.
The `BlogImage` component takes in two props, the directory of the image, and the alt text:

Here's the `BlogImage` component in its entirety:

```astro
---
// @components/BlogImage.astro
import { Image } from "astro:assets";
const { src, alt } = Astro.props;
---

<div class="blogimage">
  <Image class="image" src={src} alt={alt} />
  <figcaption id="imgcap">{alt}</figcaption>
</div>

<!-- Style is inline to work inside .mdx posts -->
<style is:inline>
  .blogimage {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 0.35rem;
    margin: 1rem 0;
  }

  .blogimage .image {
    max-width: 97%;
    height: auto;
    border-radius: 7px;
  }

  .blogimage figcaption {
    font-size: 0.85rem;
  }

  /* Replace with your own desktop media query */
  @media screen and (min-width: 687px) {
    .blogimage .image {
      max-width: 98%;
    }
  }
</style>
```

And here's how it's used inside an `.mdx` file:

```astro
<BlogImage
  src={example}
  alt="This is an example! Courtesy to Kaung Myat Min on Unsplash."
/>
```

<BlogImage
  src={example}
  alt="This is an example! Courtesy to
Kaung Myat Min on Unsplash."
/>

If you use `pnpm`,
the package `sharp` is not installed alongside Astro. You'll need to run

```
pnpm i sharp
```

to get Astro's image pre-processor to work.
