Here's a new blog that I'm finally getting around to doing! It's going to replace my old Gatsby blog (that never really had any content) over at [mattchan.xyz](https://www.mattchan.xyz), that I never updated after completing the initial tutorial back in 2020. Truthfully, I didn't have a lot of sharable, complete thoughts back then. I have somewhat more to say now. I'm tremendously excited to share it here.

Expect writeups on:

- Yakshaving/analysis paralysis
- Keyboard configurations and ergonomics
- Productivity "tools"
- Tutorial hell
- Interview prep
- The horrors and wonders of Git (and perhaps a detour into Magit)
- The Browser Company and delusions of grandeur
- Startup culture
- Lessons learnt from 3 years of Vim
- Getting images up on here (performantly!)
- Getting Things Done
